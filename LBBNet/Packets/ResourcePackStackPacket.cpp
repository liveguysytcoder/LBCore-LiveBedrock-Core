    // (per one reading of the wiki) that a client offered zero packs would
    // never bother sending a ResourcePackClientResponse at all, so the
    // server should just skip ahead. Real retail Bedrock clients don't
    // take that shortcut, though -- confirmed against an actual client's
    // log: it always finishes its own resource-pack-stage bookkeeping and
    // sends ClientCacheStatus + ResourcePackClientResponse(Completed) on
    // its own timeline, regardless of whether any packs were offered. When
    // the server jumped ahead and sent StartGame/chunks/inventory before
    // that response arrived, the client received world/spawn data while
    // it still considered itself mid-resource-pack-stage, and reacted by
    // cleanly disconnecting (RakNet ID_DISCONNECTION_NOTIFICATION) instead
    // of continuing to spawn -- it never even got to RequestChunkRadius.
    // The correct, protocol-accurate trigger for StartGame is solely
    // handleResourcePackClientResponse()'s Completed case in
    // ResourcePackClientResponsePacket.cpp; wait for that instead of
    // racing ahead of the client here.
