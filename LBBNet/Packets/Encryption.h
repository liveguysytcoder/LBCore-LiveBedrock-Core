// Bedrock's login encryption handshake uses NIST P-384 (secp384r1) ECDH key
// agreement plus ECDSA (JWT "ES384") signing — the same curve/algorithm the
// vanilla client and server use. This is only reached when a client logs in
// with a real Xbox Live identity chain (i.e. the login JWT's payload has an
// "identityPublicKey" claim) rather than the offline/no-chain flow this
// project supported before. A real official client — like Minecraft PE from
// the Play Store, signed in and online — always sends one.

// Generates the server's single EC keypair for this process's lifetime.
// Call once at startup (see executer.cpp), before any client can log in.
